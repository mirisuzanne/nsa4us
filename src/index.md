The National Security Agency/Central Security Service
(NSA/CSS)
is home to America’s
**codemakers** and **codebreakers**.
We’ve been making and breaking
all your _dirty little codes_
since 1952.
Bro code, hanky code, the code of conduct,
gay-coded villains.
You name it, we broke it.

But so-called “US Citizens”
have been developing their own secrets (un-sanctioned)
faster than we can break them!
We’ve tried everything —
from email intercepts and metadata mining
to warrantless wiretaps —
but it’s time we ask for help.
