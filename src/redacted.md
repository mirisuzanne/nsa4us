I wasn't sure what to put here,
so I pasted my _2011_ artist manifesto.
Maybe, at some point,
I'll think of something more appropriate.

**notes towards a queer art.**

So that we might stumble towards beauty _together_.

The art will speak for its self, and I must speak for mine:

Nothing is solid, nothing is set, and nothing will stay where you left it. The clouds shift. Magnetic north shifts. Your friends shift. The sun moves from the three hand to the four, and squirrels are collecting nuts. So where does that leave us?

Right here, _together_, and each of us entirely alone. Each a unique mix of _entirely un-unique_ ingredients. Blood and bones. Particles bouncing off particles become abstract thought. And somewhere in there we make love, go insane, vomit on our friends, write music, start a business, jump in front of cars, drop bombs, build rockets and sleep on our sides.

We string _together_ our best recollections and call them a matter of time. First this, then that. But in the end every story is incomplete, full of holes and misdirections. We forget to _consider the importance_ of his socks and the sweat beading on her neck. And that, to me, is beautiful.

Because life can never be said or solved. Here we are, stumbling through this wreckage and rubble, finding beauty in the world and in each other along the way. We fall between meanings and explore outside them. And art gives us a venue to _consider what remains_; what manifestos can never say.

So that is what I like. Narrative that is full of holes and questions. Bits borrowed from here and there. A relationship with the culture and art around it. Accidents triggering unexpected associations. Diverse people breathing and sweating and fighting and playing in the rubble _together_. Violence and passion and insanity and finally hope. Grasping at stability and form and meaning, but always coming up short. So that we might stumble towards meaning _together_. Towards joy and beauty, in all our _queer_ glory.
